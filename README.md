# 4236FinalProject

This is my final project for ITCS 4236. It is a sort of simple first-person shooter where you must kill all enemies and rescue captives in an underground fallout shelter.

The only things I have created for this project are the scripts, the pistol model and animations, and the level design for the shelter. Everything else was provided by either
the Unity software, or the Unity Asset Store; the exception is the gunshot sound, which was provided by Fallout New Vegas.
