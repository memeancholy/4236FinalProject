# 4236FinalProject

This is my final project for ITCS 4236. It is a sort of simple first-person shooter where you must kill all enemies and rescue captives in an underground fallout shelter.

The only things I have created for this project are the scripts, the pistol model and animations, and the level design for the shelter. Everything else was provided by either
the Unity software, or the Unity Asset Store; the exception is the gunshot sound, which was provided by Fallout New Vegas.

Known Issues: 
-Gun will continue to fire if player presses fire button while reloading.

-Player will be paused on the first frame of a game if they quit an old one, go back to the main menu, and start a new game.

-Some lighting in the shelter is weird. Don't know what to do about it.
